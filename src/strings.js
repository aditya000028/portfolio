  DESCRIPTION:
    "I have completed two internships both as a Full Stack Developer, lasting a total of a year. My first internship was with PNI Digital Media from January - April 2020. Initially commiting to a 12 month long internship, it was unfortunately cut short due to COVID-19. My second internship was with Visier from January - August 2022. I have learned quite a bit from both of these internships, especially growing in front-end development.",

  ROLE: "Software Developer Intern",
  DESCRIPTIONS: [
    "Being my second internship, I felt comfortable in my skills and was confident I was going to do well. But when the internship started and my manager asked me what I was looking to work on, I reflected on myself and realized that I always had a weakness - front-end developement. I had always shyed away from it and found it incredibly frustrating. So knowing this I replied that I would love to work on front-end work, and truly develop those skills",
    "By the end of the internship, I was able to complete many front-end features using Angular, Typescript, HTML, and CSS. This included creating a unique data structure to store 1000+ pieces of data. I also co-led development work on a different major feature, where I was responsible for doing front-end development. I regularly trained my interpersonal skills by communicating with various teams through Slack to satisfy requirements. I even got the opportunity to present some of my work to the company! And although I focused more on front-end development, I still got the chance to complete back-end tickets using Java, Scala, DBeaver, and Postman.",
    "Finally, I also took part in a company wide dev-day, which is a day to work on new things with new people. Teaming up with 2 other interns and a staff engineer, our team was able to finish in second place!",
    "Overall, I learned quite a bit from this internship, especially in front-end developement. I also improved my interpersonal skills by communicating with various teams and members regularly. Finally, I also gained experience in learning industry level backend development.",

  DESCRIPTIONS: [
    "This internship was nerve wracking to start, as it was my first one. But I was confident that my university education had prepared me to handle whatever challenges that may arise. Looking to learn and establish myself in the company, I decided to give myself enough time to do this by agreeing on a 12 month contract.",
    "Beginning the internship was exciting - I was learning industry level practices, methods and tools, while making new connections with my co-workers. I started learning and using Javascript, HTML, CSS and even XML to make many front-end changes, and updating sites for various retailers. I soon started moving towards and learning the backend system and code. I utilized C# in ASP.NET to work on completing tickets and fixing bugs through Jira. After completing a task, I also used Azure to kick off builds to then verify my changes before merging my code to production. Finally, I also got familiar with with SQL Server Management Studio to execute SQL queries for testing, debugging, and granting access to services to colleagues.",
    "As my internship started in early 2020, COVID-19 struck and my internship was unfortunately cut short. I am still very grateful for this opportunity as I got the chance to make connections, gained experience in the workforce, and learn industry best practices and methods."
