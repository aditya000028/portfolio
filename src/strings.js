  DESCRIPTION:
    "I have completed two internships both as a Full Stack Developer, lasting a total of a year. My first internship was with PNI Digital Media from January - April 2020. Initially commiting to a 12 month long internship, it was unfortunately cut short due to COVID-19. My second internship was with Visier from January - August 2022. I have learned quite a bit from both of these internships, especially growing in front-end development.",

    "Being my second internship, I felt comfortable in my skills and was confident I was going to do well. But when the internship started and my manager asked me what I was looking to work on, I reflected on myself and realized that I always had a weakness - front-end developement. I had always shyed away from it and found it incredibly frustrating. Knowing this, I replied that I would welcome front-end tasks to truly develop those skills",
    "By the end of the internship, I was able to complete many front-end features using Angular, Typescript, HTML, and CSS. This included creating a unique data structure to store 1000+ pieces of data. I also co-led development work on a different major feature, where I was responsible for doing front-end development. I regularly trained my interpersonal skills by communicating with various teams through Slack to satisfy requirements. I even got the opportunity to present some of my work to the company! And although I focused more on front-end development, I still got the chance to complete back-end tickets using Java, Scala, DBeaver, and Postman.",
    "Finally, I also took part in a company wide dev-day, which is a day to work on new things with new people. Teaming up with 2 other interns and a staff engineer, our team was able to finish in second place!",
    "Overall, I learned quite a bit from this internship, especially in front-end developement. Additionally, I improved my interpersonal skills by communicating with various teams and members regularly. Finally, I also gained experience in learning industry level backend development.",

Looking to learn and establish myself in the company, I decided to give myself enough time to do this by agreeing on a 12 month contract.",
    "Beginning the internship was exciting - I was learning industry level practices, methods and tools, while making new connections with my co-workers. I started learning and using Javascript, HTML, CSS and even XML to make many front-end changes, and updating sites for various retailers. I soon started moving towards and learning the backend system and code. I utilized C# in ASP.NET to work on completing tickets and fixing bugs through Jira. After completing a task, I also used Azure to kick off builds to then verify my changes before merging my code to production. Finally, I got familiar with with SQL Server Management Studio to execute SQL queries for testing, debugging, and granting services access to colleagues.",
    "As my internship started in early 2020, COVID-19 struck and my internship was unfortunately cut short. I am still very grateful for this opportunity as I got the chance to make connections, gained experience in the workforce, and learn industry best practices and methods."

Publishing a real website has always been a goal of mine, but I never had the time and wasn't sure about the goal of the website. But after graduating and in the midst of a seeking work opportunities, I finally decided to pursue my goal. What better website is there other than one about yourself?",
    "I first visualized the website, and the different parts of it. With the help of Figma, I practiced my UI/UX skills to design the different pages and components. After analyzing various tools, I decided to use React to develop the front-end portion of the application. I created various re-usable components, navigation, and used core React concepts to create the functionality. I used CSS for styling, and greatly improved my ability to create a beautiful (I hope) and consistent UI for an application. I also utilized packages such as MUI and react-icons to create the website.",
    "The area I improved the most upon is using cloud technologies. This website is powered by AWS, and I used multiple AWS services to show you this application. I first created AWS IAM policies and roles to allow access to objects stored in an AWS S3 bucket. I then created an AWS Cognito Identity Pool and attached the IAM policy to this pool to allow access to any visiting user. Then I used AWS Amplify to connect the service to the Github repository and create CI/CD multiple pipelines. Finally, I was able to deploy the application. With the help of AWS Route 53, I will soon be able to aquire a custom domain with a SSL certificate."

  DESCRIPTIONS: [
    "During my time in university, I was given the opportunity to work with a real client. In this course, we worked with BayTree - a non profit mentoring organization based in the UK. BayTree was doing too much manual work, where every record of mentors and mentees was on paper. This time consuming method forced them to reach out to SFU for help on modernizing their system. Their requirement was to have a web application which the admin, mentors, and mentees could access for efficient operations.",
    "In this group project of approximately 4-5 people, I took on the Product Owner and Developer roles. Therefore, I was responsible for communicating with the clients to understand their needs and priorities to ensure we build them an appropriate application. I communciated with the client on Zoom to note down their needs and feedback and iteratively improve our application. I also used Gitlab to create and prioritize issues and keep the backlog organized.",
    "One of the two main priorities was to build an API which mimicked an external Database API that BayTree was using. This was quite a challenge as we had limited resources on the workings of the API, and it was poorly documented. But ultimately, after enough testing with Postman and recording API responses, my team and I were able to create the REST API using Python and Django. I was also able to create the schema for a MySQL database which was hosted inside of a Docker container and write SQL queries to perform CRUD operations.",
    "The second main priority that we were able to address was to improve logging. The current state of the application had little to no logging coverage. So to improve logging while minimally affecting the code, I created a middleware which logged information about requests and responses. I then gathered generated logs from the Docker container using the FluentBit plugin, and uploaded them to AWS CloudWatch and Grafana. To do this, I had to create and configure monitoring and logging dashboards on these cloud technologies.",
    "Although BayTree was happy with our application, it is not yet deployed due to them doing their due diligence and comparing other platforms that would also fit their needs. But this was an excellent experience for me as I had the opportunity to learn new technologies and work with a real client."

Therefore, as a personal project, I built a microservices application which was capable of searching songs, lyrics, and creating a user profile.",
    "Using Java and Spring Boot, I got to work. I practiced dependancy injection and used my knowledge of MVC (model-view-controller) pattern to design the application, models and created various components. For the searching functionality, I used the Shazam and Genius APIs to make JSON REST API calls for fetching the song titles and lyrics.",
    "I heavily used AWS services for this project. For the login functionality, I used AWS Cognito to create user and identity pools to allow both authenticated and unauthenticated users. I also attached AWS IAM policies to each of these identities. Then for communication between the application and the AWS RDS, I created an AWS API Gateway to handle incoming requests. I defined paths, methods, and models for incoming data which would then talk to AWS Lambda functions. These functions were also written in Java, which would in turn talk to the database. Finally I used AWS Elastic Beanstalk to provision resources and host the web application.",

    "The requirement for this project included having to write basic SQL queries, but also to write multiple complex join queries, assertions, cascading and more. So using Python and Flask, we were able to connect the UI with an SQLite database to select, insert, update, and delete rows of the table. We created features seen in common e-commerce applications, such as viewing, selecting, deleting items, maintaining a shopping cart, tracking past purchases, and mocking a payment user flow. These features required me to practice my architectural skills by desiging the database schema to handle the various complex SQL queries. To give the website a visual appeal, we utilized Bootstrap with HTML and CSS.",
    "In addition to being a developer, I also took on a Product Owner role, where I was able to create issues, goals, deadlines, meeting times, and assigned tasks. I believe my communication skills are what propel me to the front of the competition, and so I was able to create an open and collaborative environment where group members were not afraid to voice their opinions. In the end, group members would often come to me for help and direction, even though I was not the most tech savvy at the time. This showcases my excellent leadership, organizational, and interpersonal skills."
