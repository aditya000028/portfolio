# Welcome to my portfolio!

This app shows a little about my journey in coding, and a little bit about myself. I highlight and summarize my work experience and projects achievements and key skills that I demontrated throughout the process. I also give information about my education, and my current status in my career.

## Tools used

This app was built using React, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It also involved using various packages such as [react-particles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-particles), [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons), and [@mui/material](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/material).

For hosting, the following AWS services were used:
- Cogito
- IAM
- Amplify
- CloudWatch

## Deployment

I have utilized various AWS services to put this app into action. To allow access to the files I have stored in my S3 bucket, I configured IAM Roles and policies to attach to the Cognito identity pools. 

Then, I used Amplify to host the static website. This involved integrating with Github to allow continious deployment (CI/CD) onto the actual website. 

## Locally running the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
